    <h3>Steps of Making soup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook the Bacon</h4>
            Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until brown and crispy. Drain bacon on paper towels and
            drain most (but not all!) of the bacon grease.
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Cook the Soup</h4>
            Cook the celery, onion, and garlic in the remaining bacon grease. Add cubed potatoes and toss with veggies.
            Return the bacon to the pan and cover all the ingredients with chicken stock. Cover and simmer until the
            potatoes are tender.

            In a separate skillet, whisk butter into melted flour until slightly thickened. Whisk in heavy cream,
            tarragon, and cilantro. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thick and creamy.

            Stir cream mixture into potato mixture.

        </li>
        <li><h4>Blend and Serve</h4>
            Transfer half of the soup to a blender and puree, then return to the Dutch oven. Season to taste and serve
            with your favorite toppings, such as crumbled bacon or shredded Cheddar cheese.</li>
    </ol>
